SWM php MVC "Framework"
=========

Use URL like this ?c=home&a=listing&id=1
It provides a simple MVC structure:

- /?c=xxxxx Include controller class
- /?a=xxxxx Call the $a action in the previous controller called
- /?id=xx   Here you get the id you need to manipulate for show or editing
- Add external class by simply add them the lib folder (files must be ".class.php" ending)

Motivation
----------
Just a practice exercice to obtain a simple, easy and evolutive mvc framework.

Todo
----------
- Corrige name of controller & model name (plural or not!)
- Use namespace to respect coding standards

Keep it simple!
